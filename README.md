This wrapper uses a release version of EmulatorJS which is under GPL-3.0
The modifications are only made in the index.html and they are to autoload a gba file that's in the same folder.
For now you'll need to place the gba file in the root folder and again in the EmulatorJS folder. I will fix this in the future.
